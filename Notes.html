first I would have a wrapper and that's where I'd put my width and pixels on either side of the boarder

you'll want to create the gradient under the header portion that is inside of the wrapper

make sure you have the active class so that it is dark in the background

the maind kitty part is going to be the hero bit. You would have a div inside called callout for the h2 with a span to float the /> and position absolute to make it work

there's also an opacity to the "the foundation of building a web"

you can put the student name stuff in a hero 

div of student-info and do a fig with a fig caption make sure the linke works for the under the student name to my main page with the mountains

then after my hero but still inside my wrapper you would have a section for each of the bottom two with the same class that for the about webdev and 4 student name and target them both with 

alt tag and p tag for the 

do a ul for the 4 student names and it can be an li and such and stule one and the rest would be styled

the footer will be in the wrapper and make sure you link to the creative circus or a cool website if you have one. 

You can change all the info in there 

do the boarder in css for the about webdev 3 pics

when you're doing your typing make sure to not do all caps
do that in css

/////////ABOUT/////////

Same nav, footer, wrapper, same lines on side

name, content, section and aside

note: the section is covering
to get them to go over the previous element is something called 
z index ********
you can do position: absolute and then do z-index: -1 so that is just going to be the order of things so the higher the number the more forward the item is (1 on top of 0 etc)

lorem ipsum is fine

/////////WORK/////////
About the same as about

you have an image of you instead that is floating left etc.


///////resources///////

Same short header that index is going over it. 
create a wrapper called inner wrap and put the all 5 boxes in that inner-wrap so that you can do margin stuff so it looks nice

you can use an article


the html books is an image that you can use as background or in it

the footer cover is a z index as well. 
background size cover will cover the entire div (what rach showed you)


Everything has the same margin so be mindful of that. 

There's a little of a drop shadow on the header as well. 

get about 80% of it done if you can by next class. You will be presenting in class
